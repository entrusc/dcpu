dcpu
====

A dcpu-16 emulator written entirely in Java. It features a small GUI that allows for direct debugging and
inspection of the memory and registers.

The emulator and/or parser can also be used as library as they are independent from the GUI.


how to build / run?
===================

The entire project is build with maven. Just clone the master branch, open the directory in NetBeans and hit run. Or if
you prefer the command line: 

    mvn package

should build everything correctly.

I also plan to upload some binaries in the near future.
